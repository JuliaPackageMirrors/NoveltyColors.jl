Contributions are absolutely welcome; however, please be sure that any color palette/package code is licensed under the terms of the [MIT "Expat" license](https://github.com/randyzwitch/NoveltyColors.jl/blob/master/LICENSE.md) or more permissive.

To submit a contribution, submit a pull request where the data file has the same structure as [WesAnderson.json](https://github.com/randyzwitch/NoveltyColors.jl/blob/master/data/wesanderson.json): the file name represents what the color palette will be called, with the values in the text file as JSON where each key is a `AbstractString` and its value will be an `AbstractArray` of hex codes.
